Downsize v0.1.0 is on CRAN!


# 2016-09-19

Versions 0.0.0 and 0.1.0 are released. In v0.1.0, the `ds()` function is deprecated. Use `downsize()` instead for new projects. Also, `scaling()` now returns either `"scaled down"` or `"scaled up"`. In addition, v0.1.0 supports the selection of entire code blocks based on the scaling of the workload. See the vignette for examples.


# 2016-09-17

Version 0.0.0 is under development, and the initial submission to CRAN is pending.
