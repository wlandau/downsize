# 2016-09-21

I am already planning v0.2.0, and I implemented the most important changes in release v0.1.1 (GitHub only). The main updates are these.

- The author and maintainer fields in the DESCRIPTION are corrected.
- There is a new `help_downsize()` function that outputs links to the vignette, troubleshooting instructions, and issues page (for bug reports, questions, and feature requests).

Downsize v0.1.0 is on CRAN!


# 2016-09-19

Versions 0.0.0 and 0.1.0 are released. In v0.1.0, the `ds()` function is deprecated. Use `downsize()` instead for new projects. Also, `scaling()` now returns either `"scaled down"` or `"scaled up"`. In addition, v0.1.0 supports the selection of entire code blocks based on the scaling of the workload. See the vignette for examples.

Version 0.0.0 is under development, and the initial submission to CRAN is pending.
