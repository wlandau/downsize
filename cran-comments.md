# Changes in version 0.2.2

- Name shortened to Will rather than William. (No need to be too formal.)
- Links updated in `help_downsize()` to reflect the pkgdown site (will-landau.com/downsize).

Thanks to [Kurt Hornik](http://statmath.wu-wien.ac.at/~hornik/software.html) for approving my submissions extremely fast and for being patient with my patches.
