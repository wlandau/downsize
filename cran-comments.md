# Changes in version 0.2.0

- Correct the author and maintainer name. Should be "William Landau", not "Landau William".
- Deprecate functions `scale_down()`, `scale_up()`, and `scaling()` in favor of `test_mode()`, `production_mode()`, and `my_mode()`. The new naming convention is clearer and more appropriate. 
- Add `help_downsize()` to print out helpful links to tutorials, instructions for troubleshooting, etc.
- Change the help files and vignette to relfect all these chanes.

Maintainer: ‘Landau William <will.landau@gmail.com>’

New maintainer:
  William Landau <will.landau@gmail.com>
Old maintainer(s):

I gave my first and last name in the incorrect order during last submission, and I would like to correct this in both the author and maintainer fields. The first name should be William, and the last name should be Landau.

Thank you for your consideration.
