Maintainer: ‘Landau William <will.landau@gmail.com>’

New maintainer:
  William Landau <will.landau@gmail.com>
Old maintainer(s):
  Landau William <will.landau@gmail.com>

I gave my first and last name in the incorrect order during last submission, and I would like to correct this. The first name should be William, and the last name should be Landau.

Thank you for your consideration.
