This is the first submission of `downsize` to CRAN. The only irregularity from `R CMD CHECK --as-cran` was

```

New submission
```

I tested the submission in R 3.3.1 on Mac OS 10.11.6 and Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 Base (via Amazon Web Services). 
There is no compiled code and no usage of 
saved files outside of R, so other platforms should work as well.
